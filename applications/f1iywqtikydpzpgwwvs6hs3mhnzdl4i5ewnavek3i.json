    "Brief history of your project and organization": "DSPA-Asia is an eco-project established with the support of PL, with the main vision to help Asian storage providers transform their FIL+ business and continuously expand the effective data storage capacity of the Filecoin eco-system. The mission of DSPA-Asia is to help 30 Filecoin CC storage providers create 1EiB QAP for the Filecoin network within 6 months.\r\n\r\nDSPA-Asia is willing to contribute to the sustainable development of all mankind by storing data from NOAA as the data owner of public datasets, including weather, satellite, climate, etc.",
