The mission of DSPA-Asia is to help 30 Filecoin CC storage providers create 1EiB QAP for the Filecoin network within 6 months.\r\n\r\nDSPA-Asia is willing to contribute to the sustainable development of all mankind by storing data from NOAA as the data owner of public datasets, including weather, satellite, climate, etc.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "NOAA Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS)",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "No response",
